# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals

The goal of this project was to investigate whether the number of bike slots across the city of Dublin, Ireland showed any statistical relationship with characteristics of nearby coffee shops. Data on bike stations (including their coordinates and total number of slots) was pulled from the CityBikes API, which provides detailed information on bike‑share networks. That data was then paired with coffee shop details from the Yelp and Foursquare APIs. These APIs offered information such as each shop’s name, its rating, and its distance from a given station. Once the datasets were combined, the focus was on looking for patterns between the number of bike slots and a few specific metrics about nearby coffee shops:

* Dependent Variable
	* Total number of bike slots at each station.

* Independent Variables
	* The average rating of coffee shops within 350 meters of each station.
	* The number of coffee shops within that same 350‑meter radius.
	* The minimum distance to the closest coffee shop.

The purpose of this analysis was to see if there are any measurable relationships between bike station slot counts and nearby coffee shop metrics. It wasn’t about proving any kind of cause‑and‑effect—just exploring the data to see if any interesting connections might emerge.
